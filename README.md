# Language Modeling with GPT-3 for Coding

Welcome to the Language Modeling with GPT-3 for Coding project! This project focuses on generating code snippets using the GPT-3 model.

## Introduction

Language modeling involves generating text based on input prompts. In this project, we leverage GPT-3 to generate code snippets using a dataset of code examples.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of code prompts and their completions. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/code_snippets.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API
- PyTorch
- Pandas

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/asimsultan/language_modeling_gpt3_coding.git
cd language_modeling_gpt3_coding

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes code prompts and their completions. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: prompt and completion.

# To fine-tune the GPT-3 model for code generation, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/code_snippets.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/api_key.txt --data_path data/code_snippets.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
